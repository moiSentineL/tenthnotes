The artificial kidney contains number of tubes with a semi-permeable membrane, suspended in a tank filled with dialysing liquid which has **the same osmotic pressure as blood.** Blood is passed onto those tubes. Through diffusion, waste products pass onto the fluid and removed. The clean blood is passed back to the patient.
