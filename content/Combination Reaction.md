When two or more reactants combine together to form a single product, the reaction is called a **Combination Reaction**.
<!--SR:!2025-09-10,660,316-->

What are some examples of Combination Reaction?
??
- Calcium Oxide (Quicklime) reacts with water to form Calcium Hydroxide (Slaked Lime) and heat.
	- $\ce{CaO(s) + H2O(l) -> Ca(OH)2(aq) + Heat}$
- Burning of Coal
	- $\ce{C(s) + O(g) -> CO2(g)}$
- Formation of water from $\ce{H2}$ and $\ce{O}$
	- $\ce{2H2(g) + O2(g) -> 2H2O(l)}$
