# Definition
Oxygen delivery is done by blood by diffusion pressure (high to low) but when the size of the animal is large, it is not enough.

Instead, **respiratory pigments** take up oxygen and deliver to the deficient tissues.
In the case of human beings, that pigment is **haemoglobin,** which is present in RBCs.
