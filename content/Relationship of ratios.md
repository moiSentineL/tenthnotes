# Definition
If $$\frac{a_1}{a_{2}}\ne \frac{b_1}{b_{2}}$$then they are intersecting (one solution) (**consistent**)

If
$$
\frac{a_1}{a_{2}} = \frac{b_1}{b_{2}} = \frac{c_1}{c_{2}}
$$
then they are coincidental (infinite solutions) (**dependent**)

If
$$
\frac{a_1}{a_{2}}= \frac{b_1}{b_{2}}\ne \frac{c_1}{c_{2}}
$$
then they are parallel (no solution) (**inconsistent**)
