# Definition
It is the type of respiration which takes place in presence of oxygen. Release of energy in aerobic respiration is lot more than [[Anaerobic Respiration]].
## Steps of Aerobic Respiration
1. [[Glycolysis]]
2. Pyruvate is broken down into $\ce{3CO2}$ and $\ce{H2O}$ and Energy
### Why $\ce{3CO2}$?
Because pyruvate is a 3-C molecule

This process takes place **in Mitochondria**
