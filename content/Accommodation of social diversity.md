## Accommodation in Democracies
Democracy is expected to produce a harmonious social life. It tries to accommodate its citizens with diverse lifestyles and culture by:
- Conducting procedural free and fair election for healthy competition and representation.
- Power-sharing -> Prudential reason
- Negotiations and Compromising with the citizens
- No society is able to fully and permanently resolve conflicts
But still, democracy tries its best to accommodate its citizens.
### vs Non-Democracies
The government or rulers in non-democracies refuse to listen to citizen and ignore their social diversity. The citizens are oppressed and the demands are refused.
Thus, they do not accommodate their citizens well.
## Conditions for accommodation (Checklist to accommodate citizens)
- Democracy is not rule by majority (overall) opinion, everyone should get a chance.
- In any case of any decision or election, anyone or any group should be able to form a majority.
- Majority must work together with minority
- Majority and minority are not permanent, changes are usual.
- Democracy should ensure to prevent majoritarianism.
- Democracy only remains a democracy until everyone has a chance to be a part of the majority, and thus be able to choose a govt.

If a democracy refuses someone from being a part of the majority, then the democracy **is not accommodating the citizen.**
