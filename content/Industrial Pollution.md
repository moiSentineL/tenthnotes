# Definition
Manufacturing industries have excessively increased pollution of air, water, land and noise. Undesirable gases, particulate matter, smoke from these industries degrade the quality of air. Industrial discharge into rivers from chemical, textile, dyeing industries along with petroleum refineries has led to water pollution.

Fertilizers and heavy metals like lead and mercury pesticides have caused degradation of water quality. Waste from nuclear power plants causes cancer and birth defects. Dumping of waste on soil renders it useless. Rainwater carries soil pollutants to groundwater which gets contaminated. Noise pollution causes irritation, hearing impairments, and increased heart rate. Industrial and construction activities make a lot of noise.
## Treating Water Pollution
- The manufacturing industry uses water for the processing of its products; it should recycle and reuse that same water.
- Rainwater harvesting should be done for meeting requirements of water.
- Hot water and effluent should be treated before releasing them into rivers and ponds. Water treatment plants should be set up for treating water before discharging them into water bodies.
