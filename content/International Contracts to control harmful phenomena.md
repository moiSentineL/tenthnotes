Here are some important international agreements signed to control global warming, ozone depletion, and various types of pollution:
# Global Warming
1. United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)
   - Year: 1992
   - Member Countries: Almost all countries are parties to the agreement.
   - Objective: To stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere and prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.

2. Kyoto Protocol
   - Year: 1997
   - Member Countries: Initially 84, now 192 countries.
   - Objective: To reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat global warming. It sets binding emission reduction targets for developed countries.

3. Paris Agreement
   - Year: 2015
   - Member Countries: 197 countries.
   - Objective: To limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius. It emphasizes international cooperation, adaptation, and financial support for developing countries.
# Ozone Depletion
4. Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer
   - Year: 1987
   - Member Countries: Almost all countries are parties to the agreement.
   - Objective: To phase out the production and consumption of ozone-depleting substances (such as chlorofluorocarbons - CFCs) in order to protect the ozone layer.
# Other Pollution
5. Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal
   - Year: 1989
   - Member Countries: 188 countries.
   - Objective: To control and regulate the transboundary movement of hazardous wastes and ensure their environmentally sound management.

6. Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs)
   - Year: 2001
   - Member Countries: 182 countries.
   - Objective: To eliminate or restrict the production and use of persistent organic pollutants that pose significant risks to human health and the environment.

7. Minamata Convention on Mercury
   - Year: 2013; put into force in 2017
   - Member Countries: 128 countries and European Union
   - Objective: The primary objective of the Minamata Convention is to minimize and, where feasible, eliminate the production, use, and release of mercury and its compounds.

These are just a few examples of international agreements focused on addressing global warming, ozone depletion, and pollution. There are numerous other regional and international agreements that contribute to environmental protection and sustainable development.
