# Definition
When power is taken away from the Central and State governments, it is called decentralisation.

**Why do we need decentralisation?** Because there are plenty of issues that can be solved only at the local level. It is easier for the people to participate in the decision making process. This helps to inculcate the habit of democratic participation and of self-governance.
For example: A problem related to roads at ward level need not have an input from the state govt. Thus it depends on the intensity of the problem.

Decentralisation was first recognised in the constitution with the amendments in **1976**, the effectiveness was low.
Major steps to make this more efficient were taken in **1992** by amendments:
## [[Steps taken for Decentralisation in 1992]]
## [[Panchayati Raj]] and [[Municipalities]]
