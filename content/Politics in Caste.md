# Definition
Instead of caste influencing politics, politics itself can influence caste in the political arena
## Politicised Casteism
- Each group tries to become bigger by engulfing neighbouring or sub-castes which were earlier excluded.
- Various caste groups are required to merge and form a coalition with other castes.
- New kinds of caste groups appear in the political arena like 'backward' or 'forward' groups.

Looking at the bright side, politics also have improved conditions of many backward groups by providing them more opportunities and resources and the ability to represent. 
Thus, caste plays a lot of roles in politics.
