# Summary
## Increase of Nationalism
Liberalism and nationalism became popular as conservative rulers came into power. This led to the upheaval in France (1830) and it again became a constitutional monarchy. Metternich stated, _"When France sneezes, rest of the Europe gets cold"_ **Why?** Because France was politically very influential because of which **July Revolution had happened which resulted in Belgium breaking away from Netherlands.** Meanwhile, the growth of nationalism had sparked the struggle of independence in Greece which had been a part of Ottoman Empire since the 15th century. The Greek nationalists got support from Western Europeans and Greeks in exile. Greece was coined "Cradle of European Civilisation". **And finally it got its independence through the Treaty of Constantinople (1832).**

## Romanticism
Idea of nationalism was spread with an emphasis to logic and scientific temple by the educated liberals, but the majority of the population was too illiterate to comprehend what was happening. **Romanticism glorified people's emotions and intuitions to spread the idea of nationalism. It was a cultural movement which criticised logic and scientific temper.** ==Johann Gottfried Herder== collected folk songs, poetry, dances of Germany end published it to recover the nationalist spirit in the people. **That is how culture: literature, music, plays, etc helped spread nationalism.** ==Karol Kurpinski== celebrated the struggle with his operas and music and turning folk dances into nationalist symbols. The brothers ==Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm== spent 6 years travelling village to village collecting folk tales. They saw the French domination as a threat to the German culture and believed that the folktales they had collected as a part of the struggle to oppose the French domination in creating German national identity.

**The nationalist feelings were kept alive through music and language in Poland.** It didn't exist as an independent territory. The Russian language was imposed everywhere in Poland after Russian occupation, yet the members of the clergy continued using Polish, which resulted in their punishment. **The use of Polish was a symbol of struggle against the Russian domination.**

## Conservatives and Nationalism.
**The conservatives could not restore the old order due to the liberal movements.** They realised that they have to give concessions to the nationalists in order to stop the revolutions. Thus, post-1848, monarchies adopted the idea of nationalism and introduced changes which had already been introduced before 1815. **Why?** Because they wanted to maintain their power and realised that modernisation could actually be ideal for them.
Meanwhile, **the contribution of women in the liberal movements in Germany had always been significant** since the beginning, yet they were denied basic rights such as suffrage and were designated as mere observers in the gallery of the parliament.
