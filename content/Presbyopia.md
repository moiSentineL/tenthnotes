# Definition
**In older people**, **due to weakening of the ciliary muscles and the decrease of flexibility of the lens**, they are not able to see the nearby objects. Sometimes they are not able to see both the nearby and distant objects. This is known as Presbyopia.
This can be corrected using a bi-focal lens, where the upper part is concave and the lower part is convex.
