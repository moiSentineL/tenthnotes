# [[Resource]] vs Asset

A resource is a source or supply that can be modified to produce goods. It can be natural or man made. 

An asset is something valuable that an individual, organisation, etc. possesses.

Assets are a type of resources but not all resources are type of assets.

Resources can be manipulated to become assets when controlled.
