# Definition
Charge is a property of matter. It can be negative or positive. There cannot be a zero-charge. If it is neutral, the amount of negative and positive charges are equal
- It is denoted by Q
## SI Unit
It is measured in Coulombs (C)
## Charge of Electrons
$$
e^{-}= 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}
$$
$$
\text{1C} = 6.25 \times 10^{18} \text{ e}
$$
## Flow of Electrons in a Circuit
The flow of electrons is from negative to positive (since there is more concentration of electrons in the negative terminal because electrons are negatively charged).
**But the flow of current is conventionally from Positive to Negative.**
## Formulae
$$
Q = ne
$$
where *n* is the number of electrons and *e* is $1.6\times10^{-19}$

What is charge? And how is it denoted?
?
Charge is a property of matter. It can be negative or positive. There cannot be a zero-charge. If it is neutral, the amount of negative and positive charges are equal
- It is denoted by Q
<!--SR:!2024-05-17,105,220-->

Charge is measured in {{Coulombs (C)}}
<!--SR:!2024-04-11,127,289-->

One electron equals to {{$1.6\times10^{-19}$ C}}
<!--SR:!2024-09-29,243,280-->

One Coulomb equals to {{$6.25 \times 10^{18}$ e}}
<!--SR:!2024-10-25,236,260-->

The flow of electrons is from {{negative to positive}}
<!--SR:!2024-03-14,100,289-->

The flow of current is  from {{Positive to Negative}}
<!--SR:!2024-03-16,105,280-->
