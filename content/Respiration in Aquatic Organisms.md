# Definition
Aquatic organisms have to breathe the dissolved oxygen in water, and for that they have specialised organs,
Because the amount of dissolved oxygen is less, they have to breath faster than terrestrial animals.
Or you can say,
$$
\text{Rate of breathing } \frac{1}\propto \text{ Amount of $\ce{O2}$}
$$
