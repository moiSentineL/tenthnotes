# Definition
Restructuring the Central-State relationship is a contributing factor to the success of federalism in India.
- For a long time, one party ruled in both Central and State level after independence (Congress). This prevented the States to exercise autonomy.
- In those states where the ruling parties were different, the central government would misuse the constitution to dismiss the government of said states. This **undermined** the spirit of federalism.
- **After 1990,** no single party got the majority in Lok Sabha elections. Thus, the parties had to form a coalition government. Hence, the **coalition era** had started.
- This led to a new culture of power-sharing and respect for the political autonomy of the state governments.
- Supreme Court also made it harder for the Central govt. to dismiss the State governments via a major judgement.

Thus the power sharing in India is more effective than it was after independence.
