# Definition
Electric Current has two properties, the Heating effect, and the [[Magnetic Effect of Electric Current]].
**Why?** The energy expended by the source is dissipated in the form of heat in the resistors.
## Joule's Law of heating
The law implies that heat produced in a resistor is:
- Directly proportional to the square of current for a given resistance
- Directly proportional to resistance for a given current
- Directly proportional to the time for which the current flows through the resistor.
## Derivation
Since heat is a form of energy, from the equation for [[Power]],
$$
P = \frac{E}{t}
$$
$$
\rightarrow H = Pt
$$
Again, variations can be:
$$
H = I^{2}Rt
$$
$$
H = \frac{V^{2}}{R}t
$$
