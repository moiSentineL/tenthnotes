# Definition
There are a few important parameters or characteristics to compare between different countries or states.
## Income
It is one of the most important attributes. Countries with higher income are considered more developed. **Why?** Because money can get you more things which humans need.
### Total Income
![clean]()

However, total income is not a good way of measurement. Because every country has a different amount of population, thus the total income will also be different. Thus we take [[Average Income]] as the unit of measurement for income.
### Classification criteria by World Bank
- Countries having >= USD 49,000 average income are classified as high income / rich countries.
- Countries having <= USD 2500 average income are classified as low income countries.
- India falls in low middle category (with USD 6700 as per-capita income).
#### Why take USD as global currency
Because of good economy. But the monopoly is ending.

At first it used to be **Barter System** for global transactions, then came **Gold**, which became obsolete due to the lack of security. Then USD became the global currency.
### Downsides of average income
It **does not** tell the distribution of money among people. 

For example, in country A, 5 people having 500 USD each will have an average of 500.
and in country B, 4 people having 0 and 1 person having 2500 will also have an average of 500.
## Education and Health
Income cannot be the only factor to compare between states or countries, thus we have some more parameters which include educational and health aspects, such as:
- [[Infant Mortality Rate]]
- [[Literacy Rate]]
- Net Attendance Ratio
- Life Expectancy
- BMI
- Human Rights
- Safety
### BMI
Body Mass Index, used to verify the health aspect. 
#### Formula
$$
\frac{Weight}{Height^{2}} = \frac{Kg}{m^{2}}
$$
## World bank vs United Nations Development Program
### World Bank
It considers the materialistic aspect for development.
- Avg. Income, etc.
### UNDP
It considers the non-materialistic aspects of life
- Education and health, Public Facilities, safety, etc.

Some countries value quality of life over income such as **Nepal**.
