## Steps for balancing an equation:
Lets take $Fe + H_2O \rightarrow Fe_3O_4 + H_2$ for the example
1. Put boxes around the formulae.
2. Create a table depicting the no. of atoms of each element in LHS and RHS.
	For example:
	
	| Element | LHS | RHS |
	| ------- | --- | --- |
	| Fe      | 1   | 3   |
	| H       | 2   | 2   |
	| O       | 1   | 4   |
3. Choose the compound with max number of atoms in it, and choose the element which has the max number of atoms in LHS and RHS. For example here, $H_2O \text{ and } Fe_3O_4$ and Oxygen.
4. Multiply the smaller value of either side with a whole number to make it the same like the bigger value, like making a common denominator.
	For example,
	
	| Atoms of Oxygen | LHS         | RHS            |
	| --------------- | ----------- | -------------- |
	| Initial         | 1 in $H_2O$ | 4 in $Fe_3O_4$ |
	| Balance         | 1 x 4       | 4              |
5. Repeat the steps until the balance is complete and all the elements have same no. of atoms in each side. For example, the above equation will turn into, $3Fe + 4H_2O \rightarrow Fe_3O_4 + 4H_2$
