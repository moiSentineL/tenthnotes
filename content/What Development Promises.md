# Definition
## Different categories of people seek different development goals. 
### Why?
Because we all possess different needs. For example, the urban kids may want a car, or a bike whereas poor kids from rural areas may want food, or education.

## A development goal for one may or may not be the same for the other, and it may even be destructive.
### Why? 
For example, industrialists want to create dams, but it may displace the people living in the area, which creates a conflict. 
Again, as stated above, what one seeks, may or may not be relevant to the other.

Thus,
### People have development goals, which are either common, or different or conflicting.
