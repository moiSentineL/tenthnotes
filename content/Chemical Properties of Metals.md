# Definition
We can distinguish them properly by following reactions
## Metals and Oxygen
Metal + Oxygen -> Metal Oxide + $\ce{H2}$
- Metal oxides are **basic in nature**. 
- Some are [[Amphoteric Oxides]].
## Metal and Water
Metal Oxide + Water -> Metal Hydroxide
### Metals react with water in different states
- Sodium, Potassium - Cold Water
- Calcium - Cold Water and starts floating due to Hydrogen gas sticking to the surface.
- Magnesium - hot water
- Aluminium, Iron, Zinc - Steam
## Metal and Acid
Metal + Acid -> Metal Salt + $\ce{H2}$
### Loophole with HNO3
Reaction with this acid does not produce $\ce{H2}$ gas. **Why?** Because it is a good oxidising agent and forms water with the hydrogen molecule. It itself gets reduced to Nitrogen Oxides
### Aqua Regia
The homogenous mixture of Conc. $\ce{HNO3}$ and Conc. $\ce{HCl}$ in the Ratio of 1:3
## Metal with Salt Solutions of Other Metals
Well, the metal with higher [[Reactivity Series|reactivity]] would displace the metal in the salt solution
For example,
$$
\ce{CuSO4 + Fe -> FeSO4 + Cu}
$$

# Flashcards

Metals and their reactions with different states of water:
?
- Sodium, Potassium - Cold Water
- Calcium - Cold Water and starts floating due to Hydrogen gas sticking to the surface.
- Magnesium - hot water
- Aluminium, Iron, Zinc - Steam
<!--SR:!2024-10-10,243,280-->

How do metals react with oxygen and then in water?
?
- Metal + Oxygen -> Metal Oxide + $\ce{H2}$
- Metal Oxide + Water -> Metal Hydroxide
<!--SR:!2024-08-22,203,280-->

Why is Hydrogen gas not produce when metal reacts with HNO3?
?
Because it is a good oxidising agent and forms water with the hydrogen molecule. It itself gets reduced to Nitrogen Oxides
<!--SR:!2024-08-12,159,224-->

Aqua Regia is the {{mixture of $\ce{HNO3}$ and $\ce{HCl}$ in the Ratio of 1:3}}
