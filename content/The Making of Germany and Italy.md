# Summary

## The Making of Germany
The liberal initiative of creating nations was suppressed and adopted by the aristocracy. Prussia took the initiative under the lead of **Otto von Bismarck**.

## Making of British Nation
in the case of Britain, it was a long drawn process **which started at 1215** when the power of monarchy was limited. The British Isles was occupied by England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland. But as England steadily grew, it extended its influence in the British Isles. In 1688, the English parliament had seized the power from the monarchies. **The Act of Union in 1707 between England, Scotland and Wales meant the formation of United Kingdom of Great Britain**. The British parliament was dominated by English members and the other cultures were suppressed. Meanwhile, Ireland was divided into Catholics and Protestants and the English helped the Protestants. After a failed revolt by **Wolfe Tonne and his United Irishman in 1798,** Ireland was forcibly incorporated into the United Kingdoms in 1801. The British nation was forced through the domination of the English culture and imperialism.
The symbols of Britain are the Flag - Union Jack and National Anthem (God save our noble King).
