Spherical lenses follow the [[Sign Convention for Spherical Mirrors]] except all measurements are taken from the optical centre.
The lens formula also gives the relationship between object and image distance and the focal length of the lens.
## Formula:
$$
\frac{1}{v} - \frac{1}{u} = \frac{1}{f}
$$
