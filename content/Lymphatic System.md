# Definition
Some amount of plasma, proteins and WBCs escape through the capillaries into the intercellular spaces. This forms the **lymph** which is colorless and contains no RBC and platelets.
- Lymph carries fat soluble nutrients, antibodies, and prevents wastage of blood.
It is basically the recycling system of the blood vessels.
## Parts of the Lymphatic System
- Lymph
- Lymph Capillaries
- Lymph Vessels
- Lymph Nodes
This forms the whole system.
## The Process
- Lymph is drained into Lymph Capillaries
- Lymph Capillaries open up to large Lymph Vessels
- Lymph nodes are present in various points which produce antibodies and lymph is filtered.
- It finally opens up to veins.

It is closely connected with the [[Blood Vessels]].
