# Definition
Take two equations, for example, in this case,
$$
x +y=3 ...(i)
$$
$$
2x+4y=8....(ii)
$$
Now, find value of $x$ in equ (i) => $$x=3-y...(iii)$$
Now, substitute that value into equ (ii)
$$
\rightarrow 2(3-y)+4y=8
$$
$$
\rightarrow 6+2y=8
$$
$$
\rightarrow y=1
$$
Now, substitute this value in equ (iii)
$$
x=3-(1)=2
$$
