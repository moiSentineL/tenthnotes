# Definition
When the number of atoms of an element is the same in LHS (Reactants) and RHS (product), then the equation is called a **Balanced Chemical Equation**.
Balancing of an equation is done in order to conserve the mass. (Law of Conservation of Mass).

Otherwise it is called a **[[Skeletal Chemical Equation]]**.

## Balancing of Ionic Equations
The charges are taken as different entities and are balanced.
For e.g,
$\ce{Zn + H^{+} -> Zn^{2+} + H2}$
$=>\ce{Zn + 2[H^{+}] -> Zn^{2+} + H2}$
