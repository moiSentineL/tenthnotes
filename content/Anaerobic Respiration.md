# Definition
This type of respiration is done in the absence of oxygen. 
## Fermentation
This process takes place in yeast and is also called **fermentation.** This is where the pyruvate breaks down to ethanol, CO2 and energy.
### Steps in fermentation
1. [[Glycolysis]]
2. Pyruvate breaks down into 2x Ethanol (2-C molecule) and $\ce{CO2}$ and energy.
## Lack of oxygen
This process takes place in the muscles when it runs out of oxygen. This is where the pyruvate is broken down into lactic acid and energy.
### Steps
1. [[Glycolysis]]
2. Pyruvate breaks down into Lactic Acid (3-C Molecule) and energy.

The build-up of lactic acid causes the muscles to cramp.
