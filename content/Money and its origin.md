# Definition
Money, is the medium of exchange between people who are seeking a good or service.
## Origin
### Barter System
Before money, or currency, people **traded** items (barter system). 
For example, if one wanted to buy a shoe and had wheat to trade, he would find someone who would give him shoes in return of wheat.
This is called **double coincidence of wants**. That is, exchanging goods for the exact item.
#### Cons with this system
- Availability of people with exact need.
- Lack of security and logistics
### Valuable items
Well, people realised that #Barter System was bullshit. So they got valuable items like gold and silver to be traded.
#### Cons
- Lack of security
- Too valuable
## Currency
So they derived to currency, namely coins (in the early days), and now, paper notes.
In our India's case:
- The currency (Rupees) cannot be refused by an Indian citizen as the method of transaction.
- The RBI issues the money (notes and coins) on behalf of the governments.
### Types of Currencies now
- Paper Notes
- Coins
- Cheque / Demand Deposit
