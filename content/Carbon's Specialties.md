# Definition
Carbon is very versatile in nature. It's nature includes:
## [[Allotropes of Carbon]]
## [[Catenation]]
## Bond with different elements
Because Carbon has tetravalency , it can share electrons and form stable bonds with other elements like hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, chlorine. According to the needs and the required number of electrons.
### Why stable bonds?
Because the carbon atom is small. The smaller the atoms, the more stable the compound will be. Bonds with bigger atoms are weak.
## [[Hydrocarbons]]
