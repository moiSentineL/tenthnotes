# Definition
While reproduction, the DNA of the parent cell is copied, that is why we appear similar to our parents. 
## In [[Asexual Reproduction]]
DNA Copying is simple, and it occurs through mitosis (thus, the same number of chromosomes).
And thus, the daughter cell is genetically identical (except for any [[Variations]])
## In [[Sexual Reproduction]]
It requires both male and female gametes, and division happens through meiosis (half of the chromosomes). There is the combination of the chromosomes in the new cell after fertilization.
The new cell inherits traits.
