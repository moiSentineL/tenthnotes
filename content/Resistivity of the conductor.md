# Definition
The resistivity of the conductor is independent of length or area or cross-section but dependent on the material and temperature.
- **Every material has a different resistivity**
- It is denoted by $\rho$ (rho)
## SI Unit
From [[Ohm's Law]],
$$
\rho =  \frac{RA}{l}
$$
Thus SI Unit of Resistivity is $\ohm \text{ m}$ (Ohm Meters)
