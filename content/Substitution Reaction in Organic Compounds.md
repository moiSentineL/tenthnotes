# Definition
Technically, this is also an oxidation type reaction, but again it is to make things simple here.
In this case, hydrogen is substituted by another element, often in a presence of an energy source (since saturated hydrocarbons are pretty stable).
## Reaction example
$$
\ce{CH4 + Cl2 ->[Sunlight] \underset{\text{Chlorofrom}}{CH3Cl} + HCl}
$$
