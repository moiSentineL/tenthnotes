# Definition
There are two types of farming that take place in Agriculture
## Subsistence Farming
This is done to suffice the needs of the people that produce the crops. This is for the consumption between themselves and not for profit.
### Primitive Subsistence Farming
This is done by traditional slash-and-burn means. Also called as *jhumming*
- This is where people burn a small patch of land and produce and move on to another patch when the fertility decreases.
- The con here is that it is major constituent to reducing the fertility of the soil.
- The land productivity is low as farmers don't use fertilisers or modern techniques.
### Intensive Subsistence Farming
This is where people try to produce the crops as efficiently as possible for the maximum output in low area. 
- This is done in areas of high population where the land sizes of individuals are small.
- Fertilisers, modern tools and labour and other means are used to improve production.
## Commercial Farming
This is done for the sole purpose of profit. Mostly in areas like Haryana and Punjab where the production of crops is high.
- This type of farming involves higher doses of modern farming techniques like fertilizers, HYVs, irrigation, etc.
### Regional differences
There maybe difference in the commercialisation of crops based on region. For example, rice is a commercial crop in Punjab, whereas it is a subsistence crop in Odisha.
### Plantations
These are also a type of commercial farming where a single crop is produced in a large area. 
- It requires a lot capital and labour and the production is used as raw materials for industry.
- Examples:
	- Tea in Assam and WB
	- Coffee in Karnataka
