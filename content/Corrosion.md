# Definition
When a metal is effected by factors like moisture, acids, etc, it damages the metal and the process is called Corrosion.
Corrosion causes damage to various bodies made of metal. Corrosion of Iron is a serious problem, it causes a lot of property damage.
## Prevention of Corrosion
- Painting
- Oiling, greasing
- Galvanisation (zinc coating)
- Anodisation (aluminium + oxide)
- [[Alloying]]
## Example
- Rusting of iron
- Corrosion of motherboard by water
