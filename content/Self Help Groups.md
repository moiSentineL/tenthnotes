But what about people who don't have collateral to get a loan? Here comes a self-help group.
- Composed of 12-20 members (mostly women).
- Daily savings according their capabilities.
- When any member needs help, they give out loans.
- If the money is not suffice, they can go to a bank to get a loan officially.
## Why banks give loans to SFGs?
Because they know that if a member fails to give money, the others must recover it. And the savings act as a collateral.
