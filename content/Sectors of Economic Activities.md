# Definition
## Economy
The process or system in which goods and services are produced, sold and bought in a country or a region. It is the operation of the supply of money, commercial activities and industry.
## Sectors
There are three sectors of economic activities. These sectors are **highly interdependent.** There would be no single sector without the other.
### Primary Sector
The Primary sector produces natural goods. For example, agriculture, which produces crops, a natural product. Another example could be dairy, again a natural product.
Since this field is dominated by agricultural activities, this sector is also called the **agriculture and related sector.**
### Secondary Sector
This sector uses the goods produced by the primary sector to transform it into something more. For example, making biscuits from wheat or making a table from the timber.
This sector involves a lot of industrial activities, thus it is also known as the **industrial sector**.
### Tertiary Sector
This sector is different from the other two. **How?** Because this doesn't really produce goods but it provides the support for the other two sectors. The activities in the sector are to provide services (Thus, it is called the **service sector**). For example, transport services, or doctors, and teachers, communication, banking, administration, etc.
**The more developed the tertiary sector, the more developed the country.**
