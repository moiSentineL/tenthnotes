# Definition
The potential difference is the difference of the concentration of electrons between two points A and B. To maintain a flow of electron ([[Electric Current]]), there has to be a potential difference.
- It is denoted by V
## SI Unit
The SI unit of Potential Difference is Volt (Voltage).
$$
\text{V =} \frac{W}{Q}
$$
where W is the Work done to move Charge Q
## 1V = 1W/1Q
The work done to move a charge is called the potential or, the charge required to do some work is potential.
## How is it maintained in a circuit?
A potential difference is maintained in a circuit by using a cell or a battery. The energy inside the cell needs to be expanded in order to maintain it.
