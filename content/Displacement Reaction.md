# Definition
When an element with higher reactivity displaces (or removes) the element with lower reactivity, it is called a **Displacement Reaction**. 
## Examples
- Iron displaces Copper Sulphate to form Iron Sulphate and Copper
	- $\ce{Fe(s) + CuSO4(aq) -> FeSO4(aq) + Cu(s)}$
- Lead displaces Copper Chloride to form Lead Chloride and Copper
	- $\ce{Pb(s) + CuCl2(aq) -> PbCl2(aq) + Cu(s)}$
- Copper displaces Silver in Silver Nitrate to form Copper Nitrate and Silver
	- $\ce{Cu + 2AgNO3 -> Cu(NO3)2 + 2Ag}$
