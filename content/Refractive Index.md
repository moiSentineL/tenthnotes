# Definition
The extent of the change in direction that takes place in a given pair of media may be expressed in terms of the refractive index. It can be linked with the speed of propagation of light in different media.
## Formulae
### Relative Refractive Index
It is in relation to another medium.
#### RI of medium 2 with respect to medium 1
Ray of light comes from Medium 1 to 2 like in Refraction#Refraction through rectangular glass slab
$$
RI_{21} = \frac{\text{Speed of light in medium 1}}{\text{Speed of light in medium 2}} = \frac{v_1}{v_2}
$$
#### RI of medium 1 with respect to medium 2
Ray of light comes from medium 2 to 1
$$
RI_{12} = \frac{\text{Speed of light in medium 2}}{\text{Speed of light in medium 1}} = \frac{v_2}{v_1}
$$
**From here we can establish a relationship that the medium of which the RI has to be found should be at the bottom and the respect medium should be at the top.**
#### Without speed of light:
RI of medium 1 with respect to 2
$$
\text{RI}_{12} = \frac{\mu_{1}}{\mu_{2}}
$$
where $\mu_{1}$ and $\mu_{2}$ are the absolute refractive indices of medium 1 and 2 respectively.
### Absolute Refractive Index
It is the refractive index of a medium with respect to vacuum (or air).
$$
RI_{m} = \frac{\text{Speed of light in vacuum}}{\text{Speed of light in medium}} = \frac{c}{v}
$$
