# Definition
The force from an external magnetic field is mutually perpendicular to both the magnetic field of a conductor and the direction of its current.

## [[Fleming's Left Hand Rule]]
## Direction of Current based on charge of particles (FLHR)
- Positive - current is the same direction of particle travelled
- Negative - current is opposite the direction of particle travelled
- No force acts on neutral particle / entity

Direction of Current based on charge of particles in FLHR:
?
- Positive - current is the same direction of particle travelled
- Negative - current is opposite the direction of particle travelled
- No force acts on neutral particle / entity
