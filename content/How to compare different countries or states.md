When we compare different things, we usually take **different parameters/characteristics on how each of them perform.**

For example, while comparing between two laptops, I'd check the processor in both, or the amount of RAM.

Similarly, while comparing countries or states, **we take the common characteristic,** and compare them on the basis of these.
