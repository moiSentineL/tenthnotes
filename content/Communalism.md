# Definition
It is when people start to believe that religion is the basis of the nation.
When beliefs of one religion is made superior to the others, when the demands of groups clash with each other and when the state uses its power to establish domination in favour of one religion, it is called as **communal politics**.
It causes major conflicts between people. It threatens the very idea of India.
## Extreme Communalism
It takes form when people start to belief that people of different religious cannot be equal citizens of one nation. Either, one of them has to dominate the others (majoritarian) or the other religions have to form other countries.
This principle is extremely flawed and possesses a threat to individuality as well as aspirations of a community.
## Forms in Politics
- Everyday life stereotypes and prejudices
- Quest for Political dominance for one's religious group. Majority leads to majoritarianism. And minority tries to make it's group stand out.
- Use of religion for voting using religious symbols and religious leaders.
- Massacre based on religious. Like the massacre at the time of partition.
