## Importance of pH in daily life
pH plays an important role in carrying out many things in the biological world.
- pH in a living body
	- Blood - 7.4; Urine - 6.5
- pH in digestion
	- Gastric Juices need a acidic environment whereas Pancreatic Juices need an alkaline env.
- pH for Tooth Decay.
	- Tooth Decay occurs in pH <5.5
- pH levels in soil.
	- The soil requires a neutral env.
	- Quick Lime (CaO) is added to make the soil basic
	- Manure is added to make the soil acidic.
- pH in chemical warfare in plants and animals
	- Insect stings contain base or acids
