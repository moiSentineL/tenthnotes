# Definition

The **Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic** states that every [[Composite Number|composite number]] can be expressed in the form of products of the powers of [[Prime Number|prime numbers]] in any order.

This expression (or factorisation) is unique in every case, i.e. there is only one combination of products of prime numbers for every natural number.

For example: $$176 = 2 \times 2\times  2 \times 2\times 11 = 2^4 \times 11$$
This can be used in [[Prime Factorisation]].
