# Definition
Unabsorbed food from the [[Small Intestine]] comes here. Here, no digestion takes place, only the absorption of water and electrolytes take place here. It secretes mucus for lubrication.
The rest of the material is removed from the body through anus and it is regulated by the anal sphincter.
It is bigger in size, and thus its name.
