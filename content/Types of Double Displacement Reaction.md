What is Neutralisation Reaction?
?
Reaction between acids and bases as reactants which form salts and water as product are called **Neutralisation Reaction**
- Sodium Hydroxide (base) reacts with Hydrochloric Acid (acid) to form Sodium Chloride (salt) and water
	- $\ce{NaOH + Hcl -> NaCl + H2O}$

What is Precipitation Reaction?
?
Any reaction that produces a precipitate is called a **Precipitation Reaction**.
- Sodium Sulphate and Barium Chloride form Barium Sulphate and Sodium Chloride.
	- $\ce{Na2So4(aq) + BaCl2(aq) -> BaSO4(s)\downarrow + 2NaCl(aq)}$
