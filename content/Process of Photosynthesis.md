- Absorption of light energy along with Carbon Dioxide and Water under the presence of Chlorophyll.
- Conversion of light energy into chemical and water and splitting of water molecules into Hydrogen and Oxygen.
- Reduction of Carbon Dioxide into Carbohydrates.

## Misconception
Upto the 20th century, we thought that the oxygen we breathe comes from the Carbon Dioxide  that the autotrophs take, but no, it is obtained from the water molecules.
