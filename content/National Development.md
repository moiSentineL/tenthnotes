# Definition
As we have noticed, every kind of people seek different goals, thus it is obvious that every kind of people have a **different belief for the development of their nation**.
They may also be conflicting.

However, questions arise such as, **Are all ideas important?**, **Who decides what's fair or what's not?**, **Is the idea benefits everyone or just a few people?**, **Does it effect a larger audience or a smaller one?**, etc. 

National development means thinking about such questions and solutions that benefit a larger audience.
