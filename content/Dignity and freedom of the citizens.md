# Definition
Democracy is superior to any form of govt. in promoting individual dignity and freedom. Everyone wants respect from another, which often creates conflicts.
The basis of democracy is **passion for freedom and respect.**
- But it is hard to give equal rights to the societies which were build on the basis of subordination and domination since long.
## Dignity of Women
- For a long time, women have struggled for their social and political rights. This has created some respect and equal rights for them
- But in some instances, women are not treated equally.
- But once laws are made, women can fight for their rights on a legal basis.
### vs Non-Democracies
- Women have no legal basis in such countries.
- The principle of individual freedom and dignity doesn't exist in non-democracies.
## [[Caste Inequalities]]
- Democracy in India has tried to eradicate any discrimination by providing any disadvantaged castes with equal rights and opportunities.
- But still in some instances, they are not given the proper treatment. But it is less frequent than in the old times.
- Recognition makes ordinary citizen value their democratic rights.
- Expectations from democracy is also a criteria for judging a democracy.
## Examination of democracy never gets over
- As democracy passes one test, it produces another. That means, when people's demands are fulfilled, they demand more, and this improves the democracy.
- People always have complains, and the people are complaining itself is an outcome of democracy.
- This shows that people are more aware and able to critically examine the work of their representatives.
- If people show dissatisfaction, it means that the democracy is successful. And it transforms people from ordinary to an informed citizen.
- People feel that their votes can make a difference.
