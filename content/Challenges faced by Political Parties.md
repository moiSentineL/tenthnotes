# Definition
There are few challenges which are faced by the political parties, which can cause disruption and are hypocritical and improper.
1. **The lack of inner democracy**: The top leaders take most of the decision and regular member could not have a say in it. Inter-organisational elections are not held and the top leaders impose their will.
2. **Dynastic Succession / Nepotism:** Once a leader is placed at a rank of authority, they try to place their relatives / close people in place of authority too, which can deprive other leaders from placing their opinion and bringing good to the society.
3. **Riches and muscle power:** The private sector and companies have money which parties use, thus they can influence the decisions of the parties. Moreover, politicians use muscle power to influence the electorate and gain votes.
4. **They offer no meaningful choice:** There is less differences in ideologies of parties, which make it even harder to choose. Moreover, politicians often don't care for the party they are in and often try to change them. They only care about the power that they will get to enjoy.
