## About
1. Pretend that it is an open book examination. 
2. There are questions, and paragraphs are only given **for help**, they don't contain direct answers.
3. Try your hard to read the first question and solve it from **your own knowledge**
4. Read the paragraph- preferably 1 or 2- and find your answer
5. Then repeat for next.
6. Starting Questions - starting paragraph, later questions - later paragraphs
