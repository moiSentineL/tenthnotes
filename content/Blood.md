# Definition
Blood is a heterogenous liquid which contains **RBCs, WBCs, Platelets** in a fluid medium called **Plasma**
## Components of Blood
### RBCs
Red Blood Cells contain [[Haemoglobin]] which helps in transferring oxygen. 
### WBCs
These are the cells which produce immunity for the body. These are of various types: Monocytes, Lymphocytes, Basophils, etc.
- Lymphocytes produces antibodies. These are present in the [[Lymphatic System]]
### Platelets
These are important for clotting. There are total 12 clotting factors which work in a **cascade event.**
### Plasma
55-60% of blood comprises of plasma which is made up of mostly water.
## Transferring of materials
**Oxygen is transferred through haemoglobin** (oxyhaemoglobin) whereas **Carbon dioxide is transferred in its dissolved from through plasma**.
- Carbon Monoxide efficiently bonds with haemoglobin
