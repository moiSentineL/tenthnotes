# Definition
The ability of a lens to converge or diverge depends on its focal length.
For example:
- Convex lens of short focal length bends light rays through large angles by focusing them closer to the optical centre.
- Concave lens of very short focal length cause high divergence.

**The degree of convergence or divergence of light rays by a lens is expressed in terms of its power. It is the reciprocal of its focal length.**
## Formula
$$
p = \frac{1}{f}
$$
## SI Unit
The SI unit of power of a lens is '**dioptre**', denoted by letter D.
- 1D is the power of a lens whose focal length is 1 Meter.
- Thus, $1\text{D} = 1\text{m}^{-1}$

**The power of a convex lens is positive while concave lens is negative**.
## Combination of power
$$
p = p_{1}+ p_{2}+p_3...
$$
