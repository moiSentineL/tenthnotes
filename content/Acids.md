# Definition
## Characteristics of Acids
Acids can be classified as
- Tastes sour
- Turns **Blue Litmus Red**
- Conduct electricity in Water
- Ionises to give $\ce{H+}$ ions
## Types of Acids
### Hydracids
These contain Hydrogen and a non-metallic element and NOT oxygen.
For example, HCl, HBr, HI, etc
### Oxy acids
These contain Hydrogen and Oxygen with some other element.
For example, $\ce{HNO3}$, $\ce{H2SO4}$
### Also can be categorised in Mineral - non-mineral acids 

## Reactions
### With Metals
- $\ce{Zn + 2HCl -> ZnCl2 + H2}$ 

An acid always reacts with metals to give salt and hydrogen gas.
$\ce{Acid + Metal -> Salt + H2}$
### With Metal Oxides
- $\ce{MgO + 2HCl -> MgCl2 + H2O}$

Metal Oxides are **basic** in nature, so a [[Neutralisation Reaction]] follows.
$\ce{Acid + Metal Oxide -> Salt + Water}$
### With Metal Carbonates / Metal Hydrogen-Carbonates
- $\ce{Na2CO3 + 2HCl -> 2NaCl + CO2 + H2O}$
- $\ce{NaHCO3 + HCL -> NaCl + CO2 + H2O}$

Acids react with Metal Carbonates / Metal Hydrogen-Carbonates to form Salt, water and Carbon-dioxide Gas 
$\ce{Acids + Metal Carbonates / Metal Hydrogen-Carbonates -> Salt + Water + CO2}$
### With Water
Acids dissolved in water dissociate and form Hydronium ions.
$\ce{HCl + H2O -> H3O+ + Cl-}$

**Why?** Because H+ ions are not stable alone, so they combine with water.
$\ce{H+ + H2O -> H3O+}$
## Flame Colours
| Na | Yellow |
| ---- | ---- |
| Mg | White |
| Al | Silver White |
| Cu | Blue |
## Testing
### Testing of Hydrogen Gas
It can be done by putting a burning candle in front. If it burns with a pop, it is Hydrogen Gas.
### Testing of Carbon Dioxide
It can be passed through a solution of $\ce{Ca(OH)2}$ (Slaked Lime), and if it turns milky (which is the result of formation of $\ce{CaCO3}$), it is Carbon Dioxide.
#### Excess Reaction
$\ce{Ca(OH)2 + CO2 -> CaCO3 + H2O}$
On passing excess CO2 in this,
$\ce{CaCO3 + H2O + CO2 ->} \underset{\text{Soluble in water}}{\ce{Ca(HCO3)2}}$

How does an acid react with a metal?
?
An acid always reacts with metals to give salt and hydrogen gas.
$\ce{Acid + Metal -> Salt + H2}$
<!--SR:!2025-01-08,344,260-->

How does an acid react with Metal Oxides?
?
Metal Oxides are **basic** in nature, so a [[Neutralisation Reaction]] follows.
$\ce{Acid + Metal Oxide -> Salt + Water}$
<!--SR:!2024-08-29,268,280-->

How does an acid react with Metal Carbonates / Metal Hydrogen-Carbonates
?
Acids react with Metal Carbonates / Metal Hydrogen-Carbonates to form Salt, water and Carbon-dioxide Gas
$\ce{Acids + Metal Carbonates / Metal Hydrogen-Carbonates -> Salt + Water + CO2}$
<!--SR:!2024-12-18,320,260-->

How do you test for hydrogen gas?
?
It can be done by putting a burning candle in front. If it burns with a pop, it is Hydrogen Gas.

How do you test for carbon-dioxide gas?
?
It can be passed through a solution of $\ce{Ca(OH)2}$ (Slaked Lime), and if it turns milky (which is the result of formation of $\ce{CaCO3}$), it is Carbon Dioxide.

How does an acid react in water?
?
Acids dissolved in water dissociate and form Hydronium ions.
$\ce{HCl + H2O -> H3O+ + Cl-}$
<!--SR:!2024-09-14,236,240-->

Why does acids form Hydronium ions in reaction with water?
?
Because H+ ions are not stable alone, so they combine with water.
$\ce{H+ + H2O -> H3O+}$
<!--SR:!2024-03-29,151,260-->

What happens when you pass excess CO2 in CaCO3 + H2O solution?
?
$\ce{CaCO3 + H2O + CO2 ->} \underset{\text{Soluble in water}}{\ce{Ca(HCO3)2}}$
