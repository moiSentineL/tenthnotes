# The Pre-Modern World
## Introduction
The process of globalisation is a long-drawn process, starting from 3000 BCE in ancient Indus Civilisation. People have been using *cowdis* from a long time as a currency.
## Silk Routes
The silk routes have been a major constituent for the pre-modern trading and cultural links between the distant parts of the world. They have existed since before the Christian Era.
- These routes joined **Asia with Europe and Northern Africa**. 
- Silk and pottery from China, textiles and spices from India travelled west via these routes.
- In return, gold and silver flowed from Europe to Asia.
- Christian missionaries and Muslim preachers travelled this route to Asia. Buddhism emerged from eastern India and spread via these routes.
- Upanishads, Panchatantra and and other Hindu texts and culture also spread from these routes.
## Food Travels
The origins of many foods are unknown, because they travelled so much. Traders and travellers introduced new crops in the lands they visited.
- The noodles came from China to become spaghetti.
- The Arab traders bought pasta to fifth-century Sicily (Italy).
- Soya, groundnuts, tomatoes, potatoes, chilli, etc. were discovered in Americas much later.
### Europe's dependency on potatoes
As the new crop arrived in Europe, the poor became much dependent on it. Many died in the **Irish Potato Famine of 1849** -> Food shortage in 1848 Europe
## Conquest, Disease and Trade
### Expansion
- Europeans found sea routes to Asia.
- The Indian ocean was bustling with goods, people, knowledge, etc.
- India was a major point for trade before 16th Century.
### American Conquest
- Before its discovery, America had been cut of from the whole world, but from 16th Century, its resources became useful to everyone.
- Metals from South America increased Europe's wealth. Many set off to South America in search for wealth.
- The Portuguese and Spanish started conquering the Americas. The most powerful weapon of the Spanish was in fact, **smallpox**. Because the native Americans had no immunity, they were *obliterated* and it *decimated* whole communities, paving the way for conquest. The first instance of Biological Warfare.
### Post 16th Century
- Due to the poverty, hunger and conflicts, many Europeans fled to Americas.
- By the 18th Century, plantations in Africa began producing for the European markets.
- Until the 18th century, China and India were among the richest countries.
- China retreated into isolation from the 15th Century. This reduced role in trade and America's rising importance shifted trade westward.
- Europe was now the centre of the world trade
