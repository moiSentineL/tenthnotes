# Definition
### Combination of Two Elements
- Burning of Coal
	- $\ce{C(s) + O(g) -> CO2(g)}$
- Hydrogen reacts with Nitrogen to form Ammonia
	- $\ce{H2 + N2 -> NH3}$
- Formation of water from $\ce{H2}$ and $\ce{O}$
	- $\ce{2H2(g) + O2(g) -> 2H2O(l)}$
### Combination of element and compound
- Carbon Monoxide reacts with Oxygen to form Carbon Dioxide
	- $\ce{CO + O2 -> CO2}$
- Sulphur Dioxide reacts with Oxygen to form Sulphite
	- $\ce{SO2 + O2 -> SO3}$
### Combination of two compounds
- Calcium Oxide (Quicklime) reacts with water to form Calcium Hydroxide (Slaked Lime) and heat.
	- $\ce{CaO(s) + H2O(l) -> Ca(OH)2(aq) + Heat}$
- $\ce{NH3 + HCl -> NH4Cl}$
