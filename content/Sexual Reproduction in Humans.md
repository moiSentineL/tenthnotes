# Definition
We humans also reproduce sexually. We have separate organs for reproduction. These organs start to mature in the period of adolescence known as Puberty.
## Female Reproductive System
![female|800]()
### The Working
The ovaries produce an egg every month. And there's a process to it. Every month, the uterus prepares for childbirth.
- The inner lining of the uterus gets thick and spongey. 
#### If the egg doesn't fertilise
The inner linings, blood vessels along with mucus comes out of the vagina. This is called menstruation
#### If egg fertilises
And embryo is formed which develops into a foetus. A tissue named placenta acts as the mediator between the two bodies to provide nutrition from the mother's blood.
After 9 months, a baby is born.
Placenta contains DNA of both the mother and the child. Interesting.
## Male Reproductive System

- The Seminal Vesicles adds fluid which is high in fructose to provide energy,
- The prostate gland gives the semen a alkaline buff to survive in acidic pH of the vagina.
- Splurt!
