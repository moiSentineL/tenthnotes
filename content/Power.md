# Definition
Power is the rate of doing work. It is the capacity of doing work. It is also the rate of using energy.
## SI Unit
The SI Unit of Power is Watts, or Joules/sec.
## Formulae
$$
P = \frac{W}{t}
$$
Also, by substitution of formulae,
$$
P = VI
$$
$$
P = I^{2}R
$$
$$
P = \frac{V^{2}}{R}
$$
## Unit of Electricity Supplied at Home
It is kWh (Kilowatt Hour). It is equivalent to 1000 Watt Hours.
### Values
$$
\text{1 kWh} = 1000\text{ Watts} \times 3600 \text{ seconds}
$$
$$
\text{1 kWh} = 3.6 \times10^{6} \text{ J}
$$
