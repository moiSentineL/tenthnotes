# Summary
## Middle of 18th Century and Habsburg Empire
There were no nation-states in the mid-18th century. The Eastern and Central Europe was under monarchial rule and with a diverse population which showed no sense of unity due to their differences. One of the example is the **Habsburg Empire** with ruled over Austria and neighbours. It was just a patchwork of people. Each region of the empire had different languages and cultures. The only tie binding these people were the common allegiance to the emperor.

## The Zollverein
The confederation of 39 states created by Napoleon's Reign had many currencies, weights and measures which proved obstacles for trade and economic growth. In **1834**, a customs union or **Zollverein** was formed which abolished tariff barriers and reduced the no. of currencies to 2. This made nationalist sentiments stronger.
### Flashcards

## Post-1815
A new wave of conservatism had spread after 1815. Conservatives now understood that modernisation could be ideal for them.
A congress consisting of the European powers- Britain, Russia, Prussia ad Austria, hosted by **Duke Metternich** sat together to plan out a settlement for Europe in **1815.** They drew up the **[[Treaty of Vienna]] (1815)** with the main objective to undo the Napoleonic changes and re-establish conservative order and monarchy. These regimes couldn't tolerate criticism, imposed censorship and denied freedom of press.
### Flashcards

Why did a new wave of conservatism spread after 1815?
?
After Napoleon was defeated, conservatives did not want the feelings of nationalism to spread, so they tried to brute force and suppress the people by trying to re-establish the conservative order.
They however understood that some amount of modernisation could actually help them to keep their power intact and be beneficial to them.

## The Revolutionaries
Due to oppression, liberals went underground after 1815. Secret-societies were made to train revolutionaries who wanted the creation of nations. One of them was Giuseppe Mazzini, born in Genoa (1807). He was a member of Carbonari and sent to exile at 24. He founded Young Italy and Young Europe. He believed that God wanted nations to exist. He was considered as the most dangerous enemy of the conservative order by Duke Metternich.
