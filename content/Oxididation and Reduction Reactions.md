## Oxidation
When an object gains Oxygen or loses Hydrogen, it is said to be oxidised.
## Reduction
When an object loses Oxygen or gains Hydrogen, it is said to be reduced.
## Examples
- Copper Oxide is reduced and Hydrogen is oxidised.
	- $\ce{CuO + H2 -> Cu + H2O}$
- Zinc Oxide is reduced and Carbon is Oxidised.
	- $\ce{ZnO + C -> Zn + CO}$
