## Rules
**Everything is based on the incident ray, and incident ray is always positive.** If ray is coming from left to right:
- The object is always placed at the left of the mirror.
- All distances parallel to the principal axis is measured from the pole of the mirror.
- Distances to the **right of the mirror is always taken as positive** and **left of the mirror is taken as negative**
- Distance perpendicular to and above the principal axis is taken as positive
- Distance perpendicular to and below the principal axis is taken as negative
