# Definition
The ability to refract light by a medium is expressed in terms of optical density. It is not the same as mass density. It shows how slow the speed of light becomes when the light ray comes. **The higher the optical density, the slower the speed of light in the medium.**

Optical density is defined by the [[Refractive Index]] of a material. The higher the optical density, the higher is the refractive index.
