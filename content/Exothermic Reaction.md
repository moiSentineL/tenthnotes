# Definition
Reactions in which heat or energy is released along with formation of products is called **Exothermic Reactions.**
## Examples of Exothermic Reactions
- Burning of Natural Gas
	- $\ce{CH4(g) + 2O2(g) -> CO2(g) + 2H2O(g)}$
- Respiration (Glucose and Oxygen to CO2 and Water and energy)
	- $\ce{C6H12O6(aq) + 6O2(aq) -> 6CO2(aq) + 6H2O(l) + energy}$
- Calcium Oxide (Quicklime) reacts with water to form Calcium Hydroxide (Slaked Lime) and heat.
	- $\ce{CaO(s) + H2O(l) -> Ca(OH)2(aq) + Heat}$
