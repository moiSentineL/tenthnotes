## The Process
Blood - via renal artery > Glomerulus -> Bowman's Capsule -> Tubule -> Collecting Duct -> Ureters -> Urinary Bladder.

- Glomerules acts like a sieve, where particles in the blood are filtered, smaller particles goes through it and reabsorbed if important.
- Tubules contain three parts; **Proximal Convoluted Tubule**, **Henle's Loop** and **Distal Convoluted Tubule**.
- Reabsorption of substances depends on **pH, osmotic pressure and equilibrium**.
