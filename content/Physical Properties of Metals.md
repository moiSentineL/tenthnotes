# Definition
There are few physical properties of metals through which one may distinguish them from non-metals.
But of course it comes with a few cons, such as there are exceptions.
## Properties
- Malleable
- Ductile
- Lustrous
- Sonorous
- Good conductors of heat
- Good conductor of electricity
- Usually Solid (except Na, K)
## Vs Non-Metals
They do not possess such abilities but there are a few exceptions
## Exceptions
1. All metals except mercury exist as solids at room temperature. In Activity 3.5, you have observed that metals have high melting points but gallium and caesium have very low melting points. These two metals will melt if you keep them on your palm. 
2. Bromine is a non-metal which is liquid in room temperatures
3. Iodine is a non-metal but it is lustrous.
4. Carbon is a non-metal that can exist in different forms. Each form is called an allotrope. Diamond, an allotrope of carbon, is the hardest natural substance known and has a very high melting and boiling point. Graphite, another allotrope of carbon, is a conductor of electricity.
5. Alkali metals (lithium, sodium, potassium) are so soft that they can be cut with a knife. They have low densities and low melting points.
