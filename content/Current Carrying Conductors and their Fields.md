## Straight CCC

we can see that a straight CCC forms a M.F. in the form of concentric circle where the centre is the conductor.
### Right Hand Thumb Rule
This rule is used to find the direction of current or the direction of magnetic field of a #Straight CCC.

## Circular Loop 
The circular loop forms M.F like this

It makes a straight line in the middle. And it makes two different poles in two different sides (like two sides of the same coin)
### Connection between Direction of current and Polar Face

## Solenoid
A solenoid is a coil made of circular loops which has a magnetic field similar to that of a bar magnet.

### Points to be noted
- M.F is the same inside all the points of a solenoid.
- A soft iron (Fe) can be used as a core to convert it into a electromagnet.
