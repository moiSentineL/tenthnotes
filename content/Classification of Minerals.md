## Metallic
### Ferrous
(In which part of iron is present) 
Examples :- Iron, manganese, Nickel, Cobalt etc. These account for about three-fourths of the total value of production of metallic minerals. They provide a strong base for development of metallurgical industries. **Iron-ore and Manganese** are the best examples of  ferrous minerals
#### Iron Ore
- Magnetite - best quality of iron ore, with highest magnetic properties
- Haematite - low quality iron ore
- Major Iron-ore belts:
	- Orissa-Jharkhand belt
	- Maharashtra - Goa belt
	- Bellary-Chitradurga-Chikmaglur-Tumkur belt
	- Durg-Bastar-Chandrapur belt
#### Manganese
- Used in manufacturing of steel and ferro-magnetic alloys.
- 10kg of Mn is used in making of 1 ton of steel.
### Non-ferrous
(In which part of iron is not present) 
Examples :- Copper, Lead, Tin, Aluminium etc. Minerals that do not contain iron content are called nonferrous minerals.
- The reserves and production of non-ferrous minerals in India is not sufficient.
- These minerals include copper, lead, zinc, bauxite, gold etc which are vital for various industries like metallurgical, engineering and electrical industries
#### Copper
It is an important mineral due to its excellent electrical conductivity.
The leading producers of copper in India are:
- Khetri mines in Rajasthan
- Balaghat mines in Madhya Pradesh
- Singhbhum district of Jharkhand
#### Bauxite
Bauxite ore is used for obtaining aluminium. It is formed by decomposition of a wide variety of rocks rich in aluminium silicates.
- Bauxite is a clay-like substance from which alumina is extracted and later alumina developed into aluminium.
## Non-metallic
Example: Mica, Salt, Potash, Limestone, etc.
#### Mica
It is used in electrical and electronics industries due to its di-electric strength, low power loss factor, insulating properties and resistance to high voltage.
- Mica occurs in the form of plates or leaves, which can be split into thin sheets. Mica can be clear, black, green, red, yellow or brown.
#### Limestone
Limestone is a rock mineral found in sedimentary rocks. It is composed of calcium carbonates or calcium and magnesium carbonates.
- Limestone is used for smelting iron ore in blast furnaces of steel plants and is the basic raw material for manufacturing of cement.
