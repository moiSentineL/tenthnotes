# Definition
## One-Party
Some countries have a **one-party system,** like China (Chinese Communist Party), which makes no available choice to the voters.
## Two-party
Again, in most of the times, only two parties usually change the leadership, even if other parties contest in a country, like UK (Labour and Conservative), or US (Republican and Democrats). The two parties are likely to win the most seats. Such system is called **Two-Party System**.
## Multi-party
In several countries, multiple parties contest and more than two parties have a chance of winning the most seats. Such is called a **multi-party system**.
In this system, a government is formed by the alliance of multiple parties, called **coalition.** 
### Alliances
When several parties join hands to win an election or to enjoy power, it is called an alliance or a front.
In India alliances were:
National Democratic Alliance, United Progressive Alliance (Left Front).

The multi party system is very messy and increases political instability. But in other sense, it allows more political representation and thriving of more opinions and ideas.
