# Definition

## How does it work?
The the curvature of the lens is controlled by the ciliary muscles.
- Ciliary muscles relaxes -> lens become thin (decreased curvature) -> increased focal length
	- To see the distant objects
- Ciliary muscles contract -> lens become thick (increased curvature) -> decreased focal length
	- To see the nearby objects
## Cataract
Sometimes the lens become milky or cloudy due to old age, this causes loss of vision. This is called cataract and can be solved using surgery.
