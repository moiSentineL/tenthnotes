# Definition
A homologous series of a functional group includes compounds with a similar difference between them (like an [[Arithmetic Progressions|AP]]). Thus, the compounds substitute  for hydrogen in the same functional group in a chain.
For example, 
- In the [[Saturated Hydrocarbons|Alkanes]] group,
	- Propane ($\ce{C3H8}$) and Butane ($\ce{C4H10}$) have a difference of $\ce{CH2}$
- In the [[Unsaturated Hydrocarbons|alkene]] group,
	- Propene ($\ce{C3H6}$) and Butene ($\ce{C4H8}$) have a difference of $\ce{CH2}$
- In the [[Functional Groups of Carbon Compounds|Alcohol]] group, 
	- Propanol ($\ce{C3H7OH}$) and Butanol ($\ce{C4H9OH}$) have a difference of $\ce{CH2}$

- The members of a homologous series have similar chemical properties.

What is a homologous series?
