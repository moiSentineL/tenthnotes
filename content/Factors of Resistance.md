# Definition
The resistance of a conductor depends on the following factors
- Length of the conductor
- Area of the cross section of the conductor
- Nature of the material of the conductor
- Temperature
## Derivatives
Through various measurements, it is found that:
- Resistance is proportional to the length of the conductor
$$
R \propto l
$$
- Resistance is inversely proportional to the area of cross-section
$$
R \propto \frac{1}{A}
$$
And thus, 
$$
R = \rho \frac{l}{a}
$$
Where $\rho$ is the [[Resistivity of the conductor]].
