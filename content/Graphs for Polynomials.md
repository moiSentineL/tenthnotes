# Definition
## Linear Polynomials
It produces a straight line.
## Quadratic Polynomial
It produces a parabola.
- Upward parabola - if a>0 (positive)
- Downward Parabola - if a<0 (negative)

## To Plot:
Take the polynomial as y and find the value by substituting x.
For example, for polynomial 2x+3,
$$
y = 2x+3
$$
taking x = 1,
y = 5

## Note
If the line TOUCHES the x-axis, it will have two roots there.
If the line CROSSES the x-axis, only one root will be there
