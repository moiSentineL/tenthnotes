What are decomposition reactions?
?
The reactions in which a single reactant breaks down to form simpler products are called **Decomposition Reactions**.
They require energy to break down the reactants, that is why they are endothermic.

- Ferrous Sulphate to Ferric Oxide and Sulphur Dioxide and Sulphur Trioxide
	- $\ce{2FeSO4(s) ->[{Heat}] Fe2O3(s) + SO2(g) + SO3(g)}$
- Calcium Carbonate (Limestone) to Calcium Oxide and Carbon Dioxide
	- $\ce{CaCO3(s) ->[{Heat}] CaO(s) + CO2(g)}$
- Lead Nitrate to Lead Oxide and Nitrogen Dioxide + Oxygen
	- $\ce{2Pb(NO3)2(s) ->[{Heat}] 2PbO(s) + 4NO2(g) + O2(g)}$
- Silver Chloride to Silver and Chlorine
	- $\ce{2AgCl(s) ->[Sunlight] 2Ag(s) + Cl2(g)}$
- Silver Bromide to Silver and Bromine
	- $\ce{2AgBr(s) ->[Sunlight] 2Ag(s) + Br2(g)}$
