# Definition
We study the work of Gregor Johannes Mendel, who worked with pea plants to study heredity.
## Why pea plants?
- They are easy to grow
- Have a visible set of characters
- Short life cycle, thus can study multiple generations in less time.
### Characters of Pea Plants
| Characters      | Dominant | Recessive   |
| --------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| Flower Colour   | Violet   | White       |
| Flower Position | Axial    | Terminal  |
| Seed Colour     | Yellow   | Green       |
| Seed Coat       | Round    | Wrinkled    |
| Pod Colour      | Green    | Yellow      |
| Pod Shape       | Inflated | Constricted |
| Plant Height    | Tall     | Short            |
## Experiments
### No. 1
He first crossed one tall plant and one short plant -> [[Law of Dominance]]
![001 Files/Excalidraw/Mendelian Exps.md#^group=o3aGH1dPZPeRj6_bsDNQZ]()

Then Self-pollinated the F1 Progeny -> [[Law of Segregation]]
![800]()
### No. 2
He crossed two plants with two different traits and then eventually self-pollinated the F1 Progeny -> [[Law of Independent Assortment]]
