# Definition
## Precautions
The acid should be poured slowly into the water, and not the water way around.
**Why?** Because acid is more dense, thus, if water is poured onto the acid, it stays on the top and causes a reaction which makes the acid splash. Whereas if you pour acid to the water, it sinks and the reaction takes place below the surface.
## Dilution
The concentration of the $\ce{H+}$ or $\ce{OH-}$ ions of acids or bases decrease when dissolved in water. This is called dilution.
