# Definition
## Characteristics of bases
Bases can be identified as:
- Tastes bitter
- Converts **Red litmus Blue**
- Ionizes to form $\ce{OH-}$ ions
## Reactions
### With Metals
Metals are usually basic in nature, so they do not react **except** in a few cases where the metal is amphoteric like Zn. Then it forms a Salt and Hydrogen Gas.

$\ce{NaOH + Zn -> Na2ZnO2 + H2}$ where $\ce{Na2ZnO2}$ is Sodium Zincate.
### With Non-metal oxides
Non metal oxides are acidic in nature, so they perform a [[Neutralisation Reaction]].

$\ce{Ca(OH)2 + CO2 -> CaCO3 + H2O}$
### With Water
Bases give $\ce{OH-}$ ions when they are dissolved in water.

- $\ce{NaOH_{(aq)}}\xrightarrow{\ce{H2O}}\ce{Na+ + OH-}$
- $\ce{KOH_{(aq)}}\xrightarrow{\ce{H2O}}\ce{K+ + OH-}$
