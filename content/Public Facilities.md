# Definition
Income by itself is not a proper indicator of material goods and services people can use.
**Why?**
Because **money cannot buy all the goods and services you may need to live well**.

For example, money cannot get you a pollution free environment, or money can't get you love.

## What are Public Services?
They fulfill our basic needs. These are provided to us by our government.
For example,
- Schools
- Hospital
- Water Supply

## Communal Development?
It comes to the community that shares the same interest that you have to support you on your goals. 

For example, you are only studying because the others want to study too and because people believe that govt. should open more schools and public facilities.
**In short, you can also survive if others survive too.**
