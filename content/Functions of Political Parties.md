# Definition
Indeed they fill up political offices and enjoy power, but also:
## Contesting elections.
Candidates are chosen from parties and they contest in elections
## They put up policies and programmes
Based on their ideology, they put up different policies and we votes choose among them based on what is suitable for us.
A government makes its policies based on the ruling party
## Role in making laws
Since laws are made in parliaments, the parties debate and come to a conclusion, which direction is guided by the party leadership.
## Form and run governments
They recruit candidates, train them, and make them ministers to run a government.
## Opposition
Those who lose, become the opposition party and criticise the ruling party and highlight flaws.
## Shaping public opinion
They highlight issues and ideas and bring them forward to the public and acts on them, launch movements, etc.
## Provide welfare scheme and government machinery.
A person prefers going to the local MLA than a government official, because of the ease of access. Thus, they are closely related to the masses, and respond to their demands.
