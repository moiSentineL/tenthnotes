# Definition
Oxidation in organic compounds lead to the formation of other function groups.
- Alkene -> Alkane -> Alcohol -> Aldehyde -> Carboxylic Acid
## More acidic as it progresses. 
The compounds get more and more acidic as they get oxidised. 
For example, though alkanes have more Hydrogen atoms than alcohols, but the fact that they are stable makes it hard for them to dissociate and from ions, but in alcohols, hydrogen atoms are more susceptible to escape (active), thus, behaving like an acid.
## Reaction
Alkaline Potassium Permanganate or Acidified Potassium Dichromate is used as oxidising agents.
$$
\ce{CH3CH2OH \xrightarrow[or Acidified \ce{K2Cr2O7} + heat]{\text{Alkaline } \ce{KMnO4} + heat} CH3COOH}
