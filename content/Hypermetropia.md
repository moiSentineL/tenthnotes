The opposite of [[Myopia]]. This is the defect in which the person cannot see the nearby objects but can see the distant objects. **This happens because the image is formed beyond the retina**. This is because the near point is pushed away.

*where N' is the near point of the normal eye and N is the near point of the hypermetropic eye.*
## Causes
This defect can be caused due to:
- Decrease of the curvature of the lens
- Decrease in length of the eyeball
## Correction
