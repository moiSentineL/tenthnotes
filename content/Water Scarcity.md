# Definition
Water scarcity means shortage of water. The availability of water resources varies over space and time, mainly due to the variations in seasonal and annual precipitation, but water scarcity in most cases is caused by over- exploitation, excessive use and unequal access to water among different social groups.
## Reasons for Water Scarcity
### Quantitative Reason
- Large and growing population increases the demand of water.
- Water is over-exploited to expand irrigated areas.
- Urbanisation and unequal access of water
- Expansion of industries.
### Qualitative Reason
- Bad Quality of water available
- Polluted by industrial, agricultural wastes
