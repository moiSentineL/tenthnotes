From this we can infer that:

|Object Position|Image Position|Nature|Size|
|---|---|---|---|
|Infinity|Focus|RI|Point sized|
|Beyond 2F|B/w 2F and F|RI|Diminished|
|2F|2F|RI|Same Size|
|b/w 2F and F|Beyond 2F|RI|Enlarged|
|Focus|Infinity|RI|Highly Enlarged|
|b/w P and F|Behind the object|VE|Enlarged|
