# Definition
1. The incident ray, refracted ray and the normal to the interface of two interfaces at the point of incidence all lie in the same plane.
2. The ratio of sine of angle of incidence to the sine of angle of refraction is a constant. This is called the Snell's law of refraction. 
	$$ \frac {\text {sin i}}{\text {sin r}} = \text{constant}
	$$
This constant value is the [[Refractive Index]] of the second medium with respect to the first.
