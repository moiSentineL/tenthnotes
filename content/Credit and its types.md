# Definition
Credit is the trust factor in which one party provides money to another party, where the second party must repay the first party back. Like loans of a bank.
## Debt-trap
Many of the borrowers use credit for investing in their business, or farming.
- Now, if the interest rate is too high, then the borrower spends his profit in repaying, thus there is no profit nor economic growth.
- In a brighter side, if the interest rate is low, and the business / farm flourishes, then there is profit and economic growth. (*Credit can be good*)
- But if the farm or business doesn't even flourish, then the borrower will need to get another loan to repay the previous loan, and thus, fall into a **debt-trap**. (*Credit can be bad*)
In a nutshell, when someone borrows credit in a high risk, and is unable to pay it back. He/she takes another loan to repay it and the cycle continues. This is called **debt-trap.**
## Formal and Informal Sources
Formal sources use proper documents, are govt. regulated (eg. [[Bank Loans]], [[Self Help Groups]]). But the [[Informal Loans|informal sources]]  are not regulated, thus they can use any means, especially malpractices.
To the contrary, informal sources are more popular due to their abundance and easy availability. **To counter this, banks should opt to give loans to much wider audiences and rural areas.**
