# Definition
The exchange of gases in plants take place through **stomatal pores** through diffusion. Inside the body, $\ce{O2}$ is diffuses and cellular respiration takes place.

The direction of diffusion is based on the environmental conditions and requirements.
**For example,** at night, when there is no photosynthesis, $\ce{CO2}$ release takes place, while in day $\ce{O2}$ release is more prominent.
