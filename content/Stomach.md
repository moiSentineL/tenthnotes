# Definition
Stomach is a J shaped Organ, which expands as food enters it. 
## Functions of Stomach
### Storage of Food
Because the food is processed batch by batch and it takes time.
### Mixing of Food with Digestive Juices
The muscular walls of the stomach help in mixing the food with digestive juices. 
### Mechanical Churning
### Regulation and flow of food into small intestine
By the pyloric sphincter.
### Partial digestion
This is done by the **gastric glands** present in the wall of the stomach. These produce Hydrochloric Acid which is used to create an acidic medium to activate the enzyme [[Pepsin]].
**Mucus is produced to protect the inner lining of the stomach from the acid.**

The food in the stomach is then moved to the [[Small Intestine]] by the pyloric sphincter
