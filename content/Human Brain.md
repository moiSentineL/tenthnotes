The Human Brain has three parts, namely
## Forebrain
It contains
- [[Cerebrum]]
- [[Diencephelon]]
### Functions of the Forebrain
- Stores information (Memory)
- Thinking
- Controlling the vision, hunger and hearing
- Receives sensory information
- Controlling voluntary movements
## Midbrain
It forms a relationship between the #Forebrain and the #Hindbrain. Also controls the **reflex** of eyes and ears
## Hindbrain
It contains
- [[Pons]]
- [[Medulla Oblongata]]
- [[Cerebellum]]
## [[Spinal Cord]]
## Protection of Brain and Spinal Cord
- Brain - Protected by the Cranium and Cerebrospinal fluid
- Spinal Cord - Protected by the vertebral column.
