# Definition
It is the movement of light from one medium to another with different [[Optical Density]] **obliquely**. The direction of light changes. This is called refraction of light.
The speed of light changes as it enters the second medium, thus it causes refraction of light.

- If the light ray moves from a rarer to denser medium, the ray will bend towards the normal and vice versa.
- Emergent ray is parallel to the incident ray.
	- **Why?** Because the extent of bending of ray of light at the interfaces are equal and opposite.

What is refraction?
?
It is the movement of light from one medium to another with different [[Optical Density]] **obliquely**. Due to the change in the speed of light, the direction of light changes. This is called refraction of light.
