# Definition
Reactions in which exchange of ions of between reactants take place, are called **Double Displacement Reactions**, basically swapping.
The ions which have the same charge get together. For example $\ce{SO4^{2-}and Mg^{2+}}$

What are the examples of a Double Displacement Reaction?
?
- $\ce{Na2So4(aq) + BaCl2(aq) -> BaSO4(s)\downarrow + 2NaCl(aq)}$
- $\ce{NaOH + Hcl -> NaCl + H2O}$
