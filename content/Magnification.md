# Definition
It is the extent to which the image is magnified with the respect to the object size.
It is the ratio of height of image and height of object. And also related to distance of object and image.
## Magnification in mirrors
$$
m = -\frac{v}{u} = \frac{h'}{h}
$$
## Magnification in lenses
$$
m = \frac{v}{u} = \frac{h'}{h}
$$
## Relationship between focal length and magnification
![clean no-t](assets/-0db59a5a8296db140252a4afffa8cfc4Relationship between focal length and magnification)
## Note
- Height for **virtual images should be taken as positive** while **real images should be taken as negative**.
- Negative magnification means that the image is **real** and positive magnification means that the image is **virtual**.
